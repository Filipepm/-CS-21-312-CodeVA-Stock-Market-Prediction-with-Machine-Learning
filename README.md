# *Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning*
## *CodeVA*
## *Project Description*
As computers become a much more integral part of society, the students of today need to begin learning how to use computers on a regular, daily basis. This is just more than learning how to type and how to send an email, students need to know how machines help us automate and how computers can be customizable tools. The organization over at CodeVA has wanted us to create a course to help students subconsciously learn how machine learning works in computers. This project will also tie in with the economics class, letting the students make active financial decisions, learn in real time whether or not those decisions were beneficial for the student, and also learn how the computer helped the student come to that conclusion.

The goal is to make a website students can navigate to and input information they think is relevant about stocks. The student will use information they learned in their economics class and learn some about stock prediction in real time. The students will learn a bit about algorithms, and what exactly they do in a computer and how. The current intention is to not really have students edit actual code that often. By inputting stock predictions and learning how algorithms read the data, the students can make decisions based on how they think the machine will interact with the stock data they provided.
